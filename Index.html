        <h2>WELCOME</h2>

        <p>The Hyde Dojo originally started at the Hyde Lads Club in the early nineties. After the lads club closed we moved to several venues before finally settling at the Longdendale Recreation Centre where we practised for eighteen years until it closed in 2014.</p>

        <p>We are now at The Ken Ward Centre, Hattersley.</p>

        <p>We practice the traditional style of Aikido, as taught by Morihei Ueshiba or O Sensei. Barry Chapman is the Head Instructor at the club and is supported by instructors Jeff Warner and Scott Derbyshire.</p>

        We are an inclusive, family-friendly club, made up of male and female members from different ages and backgrounds.

        <h2>What is Aikido?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>Aikido is an approach to dealing with aggression and violence through positive and energetic training. it applies effective martial techniques in a very unique way – by using dynamic body movements, attacks are neutralised.</p>
        <p>The skilled aikidoist is able to redirect the force of an attack safely and effectively. More significantly, aikido is designed to deal with several opponents, not just one.</p>
        <p>Morihei Ueshiba created aikido in the early 20th Century. Known to his students as “O Sensei” (Great Teacher), he was a master of several martial arts and a deeply spiritual person. He reconciled these seemingly disparate disciplines by creating aikido, a martial way to help people develop their physical, mental and spiritual potential.</p>

        <h2>What happens during a general practice session?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Generally, the class instructor (Sensei) will demonstrate a technique or movement, which the whole class will practice.  You will then find a partner and taking turns you will practice the technique on each other.  You will experience initiating an attack;  performing a defensive movement against an attack and then a full counter technique to the attack.  There will be a degree of physical contact with your partner, you will be taught controlling applications from grabbing and striking situations.   Aikido techniques can include arm locking and throwing applications. During the course of a lesson you may also get to practice with wooden swords (bokken), spears (jyo) and knives (tanto).</p>

        <h2>REASONS TO JOIN US</h2>

        <img src="Images/Group_1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Sensei" width="800" height="300">
        <br />
        <p>More than just a  martial art, there are many ways in which Aikido can improve your way of life and general well-being:</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Physically</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Aikido helps to develop all-round physical fitness in a unique manner. Unlike many other sports, where specific muscle groups are targeted and trained to develop speed, mass or power, Aikido concentrates on moving the whole body in a coordinated and relaxed manner.</p>
        <p>Because movement originates from the centre of the body, the power generated is extended naturally to the limbs in a more efficient way without putting excessive stress on joints.</p>
        <p>The result is great flexibility, efficient muscle movement, high aerobic fitness, and a reduced risk of injury through over-training.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Psychologically</h2>
        <br />
        <p>In order to be a successful aikidoka, the mind and body must become “one”. Aikido can teach you great self-awareness and control over your own body and how it moves in a three-dimensional space.</p>
        <p>
            Mental relaxation is a key part of achieving focus and understanding how to react in a hostile situation. Aikido teaches the student to face conflict pro-actively and resolve attacks in a constructive manner.
        </p>
        <p>The mindset achieved through long-term Aikido training can be applied to everyday life to resolve conflict through non-violent yet assertive means.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <br />
        <p>The great thing about Aikido training is that it can allow a well-trained Aikidoka to overcome someone who is physically bigger or stronger than themselves.</p>
        <p>Aikido is used by many police forces world-wide and in institutions where non-violent but assertive action is required.</p>
        <p>

    <div id="FAQ" class="container text-center">
        <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
        <br />
        <h2>What time should I arrive for practice?</h2>
        <p>Arrive for practice 15-20 minutes before the start time. This will allow time to prepare the dojo and for you to get changed.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What should I wear for practice?</h2>
        <p>Most beginners wear lose clothing (tracksuit or T-shirt and jog pants). Most people who have been practising for several weeks or months invest in an Judo/Aikido suit, known as a do-gi. A do-gi can be purchased on-line or at a sports shop. They can vary in price dependent upon the quality and weight of the fabric.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>How fit do I need to be to practice Aikido?</h2>
        <p>It is not critical to be able to lift heavyweights or run a marathon to practice Aikido. Fitness levels need to moderate as we encourage people to practice at their own pace and ability. It is, however, important that you let the class instructor (or Sensei) know if you have any specific medical conditions or medication requirements before you begin practicing.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What does it cost to practice Aikido? Will I be insured against any injuries?</h2>
        <p>The £40 yearly fee covers individual insurance against injury. Details of levels of cover are available on request. All instructors are covered by indemnity insurances.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What kinds of things will I learn at the lesson?</h2>
        <p>Generally, the class instructor (Sensei) will demonstrate a technique or movement, which the whole class will practice. You will then find a partner and taking turns you will practice the technique on each other. You will experience initiating an attack; performing a defensive movement against an attack and then a full counter technique to the attack. There will be a degree of physical contact with your partner, you will be taught controlling applications from grabbing and striking situations. Aikido techniques can include arm locking and throwing applications. During the course of a lesson you may also get to practice with wooden swords (bokken), spears (jyo) and knives (tanto)</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Who will be teaching me?</h2>
        <p>Any one of the five ‘black belt’ level instructors listed in the instructors section of this website. Each instructor will have a slightly different view on Aikido which will enhance your understanding of the Martial Art.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What is the grading system?</h2>
        <p>Generally a beginner will start with a red belt. After completing a grading (examination) you can progress to the next grade 6th kyu or white belt. After the successful completion of the next grading you will progress to 5th kyu or yellow belt. Then 4th kyu or orange belt, 3rd kyu green belt, 2nd kyu blue belt, 1st kyu brown belt then onto black belt or sho-dan.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What do I have to do in a grading?</h2>
        <p>Please refer to the grading syllabus section of this site and enjoy the clips in the Techniques section. For detailed information, please contact one of the instructors.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>How long does it take to reach the level of black belt?</h2>
        <p>Generally, it takes about 5 years. Some people are quicker and others slower – it really depends on you,  how much you practice, how well your mind and body adapts and how well you understand Aikido techniques and principles</p>

                <p>I remember the first time I walked through the doors of the dojo, I was very nervous.  I was, however, instantly made to feel at ease and welcomed by the clubs instructors and students.</p>
                <p>The instructors at the Hyde dojo are diligent, selfless and devoted to helping their students to learn and improve. In addition to this, all higher grade students are always prepared to take the time to explain and demonstrate the techniques to develop my understanding.</p>
                <p>It was encouraging to be taught in a safe and controlled manner.  The instructors were careful to explain where the dangerous parts of the techniques were and how best to prevent injuries to myself and fellow training partner. Macho ego tripping is certainly not tolerated when training at the Hyde dojo.</p>
                <p>Attending the club every Tuesday and Friday has now become part of my weekly routine.  I enjoy practising regularly with like- minded people in an encouraging environment. Training helps me to release the stresses of modern life.  I feel that Aikido is improving my fitness and nurturing my inner well-being and harmony</p>
                <p>I recently took my first grading at the club after 6 months of training.  I had to learn a lot of new things that tested both my mind and body. I must say it was quite a challenge.  I was really pleased when the Sensei (teacher) said I had passed and I had done really well. I now have a new challenge moving on to the next grade</p>
                <p>So if you wish to learn a martial art, have fun and pick up some good values along the way, I would strongly recommend Aikido Manchester, the Hyde dojo.</p>

                <h2>Finding Aikido: A Beginner’s Tale, By Len Holowko</h2>
                <p>During a family BBQ in June 2011 and after a few shandies, my wife and I were reminiscing.  We asked each other if there was anything in our lives that we would have done differently.  I said ‘I wished that I had done some martial arts training’.  The response was instant laughter, which got my back up.  In a fit of pique I said that I was going to look for a club to join, to which my wife asked “what martial art are you going to do then?” whilst sniggering.  I said Aikido, as I have always admired the art of the Samurai and Japanese culture, and promptly went to my laptop to search for a local dojo.  I was secretly hoping that there wasn’t one, whilst trying to save face with my wife.  I googled for Aikido clubs in the Manchester area.  Aikido Seishin Kai was at the top of the page so I sent a message in the contact page asking if it was too late for an overweight 52-year-old to start Aikido.  Within half an hour I received a reply saying, as long as I was reasonably fit then I would be made welcome.  Still trying to save face, I said to my wife I was going to go to the next lesson.</p>
